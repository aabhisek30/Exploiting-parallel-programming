## Parallel Matrix Multiplication


![Concept of parallel multiplication](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67454437/121626802-bfb14080-ca93-11eb-9c83-270bf9ec2e92.png)

From above figure,

### Divide matrix A and B into 4 equal parts
### Creating 8 separte process to multiply submatrices individually as follows:-

1. process 1 - A11 * B11
2. process 2 - A12 * B21
3. process 3 - A11 * B12
4. process 4 - A12 * B22
5. process 5 - A21 * B11
6. process 6 - A21 * B21
7. process 7 - A21 * B12
8. process 8 - A22 * B22

### Creating 4 seperate process to add result of above matrices

1. process 1 - A11 * B11 + A12 * B21
2. process 2 - A11 * B12 + A12 * B22
3. process 3 - A21 * B11 + A22 * B21
4. process 4 - A21 * B12 + A22 * B22

### Now combining result of above submatrices into 1 single matrice


## Parallel searching across matrix

### Divide matrix into 4 submatrices
### Now for every submatrices , one process is created , so four process is created for 4 submatrices.
1. For every process, call searchvalue matrices with low and end values
2. searchvalue() returns the number of count of values in the range of (low,end) for every row of matrix
