## Parallel Matrix Multiplication


![Concept of parallel multiplication](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67454437/121626802-bfb14080-ca93-11eb-9c83-270bf9ec2e92.png)

From above figure,

Divide matrix A and B into 4 equal parts
Creating 8 separte process to multiply submatrices individually as follows:-
process 1 - A11 * B11
process 2 - A12 * B21
process 3 - A11 * B12
process 4 - A12 * B22
process 5 - A21 * B11
process 6 - A21 * B21
process 7 - A21 * B12
process 8 - A22 * B22
Creating 4 seperate process to add result of above matrices
process 1 - A11 * B11 + A12 * B21
process 2 - A11 * B12 + A12 * B22
process 3 - A21 * B11 + A22 * B21
process 4 - A21 * B12 + A22 * B22
Now combining result of above submatrices into 1 single matrices


## Parallel searching accross matrix

Divide matrix into 4 submatrices
Now for every submatrices , one process is created , so four process is created for 4 submatrices.
For every process, call searchvalue matrices with low and end values
searchvalue() returns the number of count of values in the range of (low,end) for every row of matrix
